# ATLAS Higgs machine learning challenge

This is a modified version of the original ATLAS ML challenge, hosted by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson). The challenge consists of classifying certain rare decays of the Higgs boson, measured at the ATLAS detector facility at CERN, as signal or background based on up to 30 input parameters. A machine learning approach using Bossted Decision Trees or Aritficial Neural Networks is justified. This was the final examination for the course physics718 @ Bonn university. I present here my Code as a Jupyter Notebook along with a written report which was also part of the examination. I passed the course with a grade of 1.0.

The data was provided by [Dr. Eckardt v. TÃ¶rne](https://web.physik.uni-bonn.de/members/vcard.php?v=251)
