# ATLAS Higgs machine learning challenge

This is a modified version of the original ATLAS ML challenge, hosted by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson). This was the final examination for the course physics718 @ Bonn university. I present here my Code as a Jupyter Notebook along with a written report which was also part of the examination. I passed the course with the best possible grade of 1.0.
